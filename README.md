# hello-world

//hello all,

/*This is my first experience using git or any kind of repository. Im acually not \n
even a programmer yet. Ive never written code outside the basic C++ tutorials that have you do \n
stuff like "hello World!", or generate a srand functions that makes random numbers based off of \n
ctime and little things like that. My goals here are to start seeing code and how it works and \n 
start getting active and meeting like minded people that can point me in the right directions.\n
Im currently a CIS major just starting out and I'm really looking forward to growing as a programmer \n
and developer and I just want to thank everyone now for any help they give me along the way.*/
